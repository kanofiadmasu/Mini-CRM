# MINI-CRM 

This is my second personal project that I building only using python to solidify my understanding in python. This is a CLI App that is usefull for freelancers.
It is designed to help freelancers to track their projects, manage clients, manage their finances. 

This project is teaching me a lot of new concepts in python and also industry standard concepts like software development cycle, Design flows, planning software before building it and technical lessons like 
function dispatching, some design patterns(extensible design pattern), and many more concpets. 

The project is not completed but it will have the following features
## Features of the app
  1. CLI options
  2. Managing Clients-- that has sub options like adding clients, searching clients, showing the list of clients.
  3. Managing Projects
  4. Creating Invoices
  5. Recording Payments

 I plan to improve the efficeincy and functionaliy of the app, while still learning more about software development and also the python programming language. 

## Project history
***Aug 26/2025***   

Today I added a Deletion feature that will enable users to select and delete the selected client. This function or feature is under the manage clients section. 
## The main concepts used in this function is:
      1. File Handling-- For reading files, and also for updating file using write mode after a client is deleted. 
      2. Error/Exception Handling-- Here we used this to handle errors that can rise from corruption of loss of the text file. 
      3. Conditonals-- to compare and excute the input of user.  

This are the main concepts used to build this feature. And this is the last feature of the manage clients section.
