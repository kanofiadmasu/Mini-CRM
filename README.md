# MINI-CRM 

This is the second personal project that I built only using python to solidify my understanding in the language. This is a CLI App that is usefull for freelancers.
It is designed to help freelancers to track their projects, manage clients, and manage their finances. 


## Features of the app

This app is a CRUD app, that has CRUD operations for each objects (Clients, Projects, Invoices) in the app. The main fucntionality is:

    1. Managing Clients
    2. Managing Projects
    3. Creating Invoices

## Instalation 

Python 3.8+ is required

Clone the repo and head to the folder.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kanofiadmasu/Mini-CRM
    cd Mini-CRM
    ```

## Usage 

Once installed, simply run the file and you can interact with the software easily. 

When running on the terminal, there will be an output option to which object to manage, either Clients, Projects, or, Invoices. After selecting one you can do full CRUD opretions on them. 

    1. Mange Clients
    2. Mange Projects
    3. Mange Invoices
