# MINI-CRM 

This is my second personal project that I am building only using python to solidify my understanding in python. This is a CLI App that is usefull for freelancers.
It is designed to help freelancers to track their projects, manage clients, and manage their finances. 

This project is teaching me a lot of new concepts in python and also industry standard concepts like software development cycle, Design flows, planning software before building it and technical lessons like function dispatching, some design patterns(extensible design pattern), and many more concpets. 

The project is not completed but it will have the following features
## Features of the app
  1. CLI options
  2. Managing Clients-- that has sub options like adding clients, searching clients, showing the list of clients.
  3. Managing Projects
  4. Creating Invoices
  5. Recording Payments

 I plan to improve the efficeincy and functionaliy of the app, while still learning more about software development and also the python programming language.
